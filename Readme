The Software built on Visual Basic is aimed to act as an interface for managing the services provided by an ISP( Internet Service Provider). 

The services we have catered to include broadband, TV, ISD/STD code search and Data Plans for Mobile Networks.

Overview:

The S/W has 2 intefaces

-- First One ( we call it User Panel ) for the general users who are using one or more service provided by the ISP
-- Second One ( named the Admin Panel ) for the Admins of the ISP who can review the activity of the first kind users

Points to Note:

1. There is a single login page for both interfaces. To login as Admin :
  Mobile Number : Admin
  Password : GN13
